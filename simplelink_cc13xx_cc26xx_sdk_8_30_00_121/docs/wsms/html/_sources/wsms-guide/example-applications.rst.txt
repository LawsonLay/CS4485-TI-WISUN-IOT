Example Application Guide
=========================

This section provides an overview of the |STACK| out-of-box example applications
and instructions on how to run them.

IN WSMS, there are two types of logical devices:

* The base device
* Node devices.

The |STACK| can be configured in either of the two roles by choosing the
corresponding application.

IPv6 Node Embedded Mode Example Application (ipv6_node)
-------------------------------------------------------

A node is a device capable of connecting to other devices in the mesh network.
It can provide upward and downward packet forwarding. A new device is able to
join the network through any node. The connections between different nodes form
the mesh topology.

The ``ipv6_node`` example is a fully embedded application demonstrating a CoAP
server on WSMS. The example is intended to work with the base example, which
acts as the CoAP client that interacts via the CoAP protocol with the CoAP node
server. CoAP is an abbreviation of COnstrained Application Protocol.

Running the Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For information on how to run the router node example application please see the
``README.md`` included with the application project.

Device support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``ipv6_node`` is supported on the following development boards:

- CC1312R7 LaunchPad
- CC1352P7-1 LaunchPad
- LP_EM_CC1314R10
- LP_EM_CC1354P10_1
- LP_EM_CC1354P10_6


IPv6 Base Example Application (ipv6_base)
-----------------------------------------

A base device is a device that can act as gateway between the WSMS network and a
different network. In addition, the base acts as the :term:`root` device and
establishes the network. For this reason, a WSMS network needs at least one base.
The ``ipv6_base`` example implements the base with NWP mode architecture.

Running the Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For information on how to run the base example application please see the
``README.md`` included with the application project.

Device support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``ipv6_base`` is supported on the following development boards:

- CC1312R7 LaunchPad
- CC1352P7-1 LaunchPad
- LP_EM_CC1314R10
- LP_EM_CC1354P10_1
- LP_EM_CC1354P10_6

Configuration Parameters
------------------------

Example configuration is done mainly through SysConfig. You can read about
SysConfig configuration in the TI Wi-SUN FAN Stack User's Guide.

For NWP mode, many values can be set at run time through the NWP interface. Please
see the NWP interface guide in the TI WI-SUN FAN Stack User's Guide or
the ti-wisunfan py-spinel readme for details.
