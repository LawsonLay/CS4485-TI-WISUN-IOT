    Code Composer Studio

        An integrated development environment to develop applications for
        Texas Instruments embedded processors. Download: `Code Composer
        Studio`_

    cJTAG
    compact JTAG

        Class 4 IEEE 1149.7: Standard for Reduced-pin and
        Enhanced-functionality Test Access Port and Boundary-scan Architecture.
        This is known by acronym cJTAG.

    CSMA-CA

        Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance

        Common User Interface

    DMM
    Dynamic Multi-protocol Manager

        An arbiter between multiple protocol stacks that are sharing the multi

        Zigbee devices designed for applications with a strict energy budget.

    GPDF
    Green Power Data Frames

        Data frames transferred by Green Power Devices.
    
    GPP
    Green Power Proxy

        Any Zigbee device capable of routing Green Power Data Frames.
    
    GPS
    Green Power Sink

        Zigbee device responsible for commissioning Green Power Devices into the 
        network.

    GPRAM
    General purpose RAM 

        This memory area is used for the cache per default,
        but can be configured to be used as RAM.

    IAR

        Refers to IAR Systems' IAR Embedded Workbench, which is an integrated
        development environment used for building and debugging embedded
        applications.

    IEEE 802.15.4

        The Institue of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 802.15.4 protocol
        specifies the physical and medium access layers for wireless Personal
        Area Networks targeted at low power, low data rate applications

    JTAG
    Joint Test Action Group
    
        IEEE standard 1149.1: Standard Test Access Port and Boundary Scan
        Architecture Test Access Port (TAP). This standard is known by the
        acronym JTAG.

    LQI
    Link Quality Indicator

        A measurement of the quality of a received packet. LQI measurements are
        performed on by the RF core by measuring the signal to noise ratio (SNR)
        of the desired signal to the in-band noise.

    MCU
    Microcontroller Unit

        A small computer on a single integrated circuit.

    MT

    OSAL

        Operating System Abstraction Layer

    OTA

        Over the Air

    OTA Client

        A device capable of downloading an image from an :term:`OTA Server`
        using the OTA cluster

    OTA Server

        A device capable of hosting an image for download by an :term:`OTA Client` 
        using the OTA cluster

    PAN

        Personal Area Network

    ROM
    Read-only Memory
