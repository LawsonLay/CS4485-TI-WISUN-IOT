Kernel Configuration
--------------------

|TIRTOS| applications use the `SysConfig`_ Tool to configure the kernel. When 
building the project, SysConfig will automatically generate the 
``ti_sysbios_config.c`` and ``ti_sysbios_config.h`` files as explained in
the |TI-RTOS_UG|.

    SysConfig TI-RTOS7 Kernel Configuration

Some of the options that can be configured are:

- Boot options

- Number of Hwi, Swi, and Task priorities

- Exception and Error handling

- The duration of a System tick (the most fundamental *unit* of time in the
  |TIRTOS| kernel).

- Defining the application's entry point and interrupt vector

- |TIRTOS| heaps and stacks

- Including pre-compiled kernel and |TIRTOS| driver libraries

- System providers (for ``System_printf()``)

For additional documentation in regards to the list described above, see the
|TI-RTOS_UG|.
