Using WSMS Projects with CCS
-------------------------------

Importing WSMS projects into CCS will also import a ``README.md`` that
details the example application design, steps on running the example, and how
each example works.

For more details on TI WSMS Stack example application please see the
|WSMS Stack User's Guide|.

Import Project Using Resource Explorer
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A quick and easy way to start working with the SDK is to use the TI Resource
Explorer in CCS.

This section describes how to import and build an existing project and
references the *node* project. This project is an example for a WSMS node
node. All of WSMS projects included in the development kit have a similar
structure.

#. Open the CCS IDE from the Start Menu.
#. Create a workspace.

    .. attention::

        Ensure that the CCS workspace path does not contain a whitespace.

#. Import a CCS Project using Resource Explorer

    -   Open Resource Explorer (if not open already) **View** -> **Resource
        Explorer** - Navigate to the CCS folder for your chosen example:
        **Software ->** |SDK| **-> Examples ->** \ \{BOARD_NAME\} **->
        wsms -> wsms_ipv6node -> tirtos7 -> ticlang -> wsms_ipv6node_**

#.  Select the CCS Logo button to import the project into your workspace.

    .. attention::

        The import process will also install the |SDK| if a local version does
        not exist. You must accept the End User License Agreement to proceeed.

        .. figure:: resources/eula.png
            :align: center

            Install |SDK|

        After the installation finishes, you must reopen CCS before importing
        the project.

    - If everything is successful, the project should appear in Resource
      Explorer.


Import Project Using Import Wizard
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

#. Open CCS
#. Choose Project -> Import CCS Projects... from the menu.
#. Select the Browse button in the Import CCS Projects dialog and select the the
   directory ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/examples``

    .. _fig-wsms-ccs-import-wizard:
    .. figure:: resources/tidrivers/ccs-import-wizard.jpg
        :align: center

        CCS Import Wizard

   CCS discovers all examples supported, regardless of compiler.
#. Select the WSMS Example Project you would like to use. In this example,
   ``wsms_ipv6node_LP_EM_CC1354P10_1_tirtos7_ticlang`` is chosen. Click Finish
   to import the ``wsms_ipv6node_LP_EM_CC1354P10_1_tirtos7_ticlang`` project.

Build and Download Project
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

  +-----------------+-----------------+

When the debugging session opens, click the Green start button to start
execution. Continue on to the ``README.md`` for information about using the
example application.

Using WSMS Projects with IAR
------------------------------

Importing a WSMS project into IAR will also import a README.md
that details the example application design, steps on running the example, and
how each example works.

When building with IAR, it is recommended to enable all build messages. This
can be done by right-clicking in the Build window and selecting "All" as shown
below:

    .. figure:: resources/ble5/ble5_iar_enable_build_messages.png
        :align: center

        Enable All Build Messages

.. warning::
    Standalone SysConfig tool must be installed in order to use all the IAR projects and
    its location has to the same as specified by ``SYSCONFIG_ROOT``.

    The SysConfig standalone package can be found here: `SysConfig Standalone Installer Download Page`_.

IAR One-Time Configuration
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Below you can see how to add and enable the SDK-global argument variables. This
is necessary before importing any project.

    .. figure:: resources/iar_custom_argvars_menu.png

        Select Configure Custom Argument Variables from the Tools menu


    .. figure:: resources/iar_custom_argvars_empty.png

        Click on Import... with either the Workspace or Global namespace
        selected. For Global, the imported values will persist for other
        projects also.


    .. figure:: resources/iar_custom_argvars_file.png

        Find the Custom Argument Variables file under ``<SDK root>/tools/iar``


    .. figure:: resources/iar_custom_argvars_selected.png

        Success! Change these paths if you have installed in a different location.

.. note::
    If you have imported the global
    ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/tools/iar/SIMPLELINK_CC13XX_CC26XX_SDK.custom_argvars``,
    then the examples from the older SDKs will fail to build.

Import Project Using Workspace

.. _quick-start-wsms-demo:

Running the Demo
----------------

For information on running any of the WSMS example applications please refer
to the ``README.md`` imported with the example application.

When using the example in network processor mode, a host device running TI Wi-SUN
FAN pySpinel scripts is needed. A description for setting this up is found in
the `TI Wi-SUN FAN pySpinel GitHub repo`_.


.. _quick-start-wsms-develop:

Developing a New WSMS Based Application
------------------------------------------

The develop track can be summarized with the following steps:

#.  **Download the Simplelink SDK**

    The `SimpleLink CC13XX CC26XX SDK`_ contains the code neccessary to start developing a WSMS
    application. The stack library code implements the WSMS stack, and the
    various example projects use the stack library to implement applications.
    These examples should be considered as starting points for end product design.

#.  **Get Familiar with the Userâ€™s Guide**

    This User's Guide is meant to be used alongside the example projects when
    developing an end product. It contains documentation on the stack
    architecture, APIs and suggestions for developing applications. To jump to
    the Table of Contents, click here:  |WSMS Stack User's Guide|.

#.  **Select an Example Project**

    The WSMS includes a basic set of projects to use as a starting point for
    development of your custom application. TI recommends that users start their
    development of project with the ipv6 Base and ipv6 Node example
    applications. For more details on these and all other included projects, see
    the |WSMS Stack User's Guide|.

#.  **Begin Development with an IDE**

    An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can be set up to make it easier
    to browse through the relevant projects and view code. All embedded software
    is developed using TI's Code Composer Studio on a Windows 10 or later
    PC.

#.  **Troubleshooting Help**

    While developing your custom application, you may run into issues that
    require the use of a debugger. The |WSMS Stack User's Guide| provides
    help with configuring your debugger and understanding common problems. If
    you are still having problems after reading through the Debugging chapter,
    see the :ref:`quick-start-wsms-support` track for more options.
