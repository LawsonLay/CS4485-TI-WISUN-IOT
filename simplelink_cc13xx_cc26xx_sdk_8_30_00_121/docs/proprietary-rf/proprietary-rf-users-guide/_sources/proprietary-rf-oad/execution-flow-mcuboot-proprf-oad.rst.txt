Execution flow of MCUBoot Based Proprietary RF OAD
--------------------------------------------------

This section briefly describes how the MCUBoot and the Client application work together
to enable OAD functionality.

When using the MCUBoot, there is no need for a peristent app, since
the slots for incoming image and existing image are predefined.

The functional flow of an On-chip Flash OAD process is shown in the diagram.

.. note::
    Proprietary RF OAD uses the overwrite method of managing images on Flash.
    The newly updated image is overwritten onto the primary slot and then executed from
    the primary slot.
