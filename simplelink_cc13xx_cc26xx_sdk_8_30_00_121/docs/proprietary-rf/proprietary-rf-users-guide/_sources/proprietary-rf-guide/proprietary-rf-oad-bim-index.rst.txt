#####################################

The following sections aim to describe the lower layers of OAD software that are
common across all protocol stack implementations. This includes the OAD image
header, the flash layout, Boot Image Manager, and the oad\_image\_tool.

.. warning::

    The Proprietary RF OAD Profile does not implement or perform any security or
    authentication mechanisms as part of the firmware update process. System developers
    should take measures to adequately authenticate peer devices and only accept and/or
    apply firmware images transferred from trusted sources via the OAD Profile.

The following sections aim to describe the application and profile layer of the
Proprietary RF OAD. The OAD application section will describe the
OAD process from a high level in terms of events and states, and the
profile section will cover the actual structures that are sent over the air.
