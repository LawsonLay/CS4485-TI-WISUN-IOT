This project was a collaborative final project between 10 ECE students and CS students at the University of Texas at Dallas for the Fall 2025 and Spring 2025 semesters.
For the ECE students, the project lasted 2 semesters, while the CS students switched out each semester.
This repo only contains information pertaining to the Spring 2025 semester.

In the Spring 2025 semester, we, the students, created a minature smart city to simulate an application of Wi-SUN technology using Texas Instruments' LaunchPads, ti-web-app, ti-wfantund, the Kea DHCPv6 server, and a BeaglePlay. The smart city had force-sensing resistors across parts of the road. When run over by a RC car, the sensor would send a CoAP request to the central ti-web-app, to activate the corresponding light zone. All Router Nodes (sensors and lights) could be managed and monitored via our modified ti-web-app in real-time.
